# gatling-bolt

https://boltprotocol.org/[Bolt] support for http://www.gatling.io[Gatling]. Bolt is the binary protocol to communicate with http://neo4j.com[neo4j]. The goal of this project is to provide support for bolt within gatling in a as seamless way as possible.

2nd goal is to teach myself scala.

WARNING: This project contains my very first lines of scala code, so be prepared to find silly nonsense stuff here. If you do, pls drop me a note.

## status

For now `gatling-bolt` is in a POC status, connection and basic reporting works.

We're lacking support for more-than-one statement scenarios, validating results and many more.

## build & install

Just do a `sbt assembly` and copy `./target/scala-2.12/gatling-bolt-assembly-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` to your gatling installation at `$GATLING_HOME/lib/`


If you want to use a separate self-contained gatling project as documented on https://technicaldifficulties.io/2018/11/15/bundling-gatling-tests-into-an-executable-jar/ you need to call `sbt publishM2` to make `gatling-bolt` available in your local maven repo.

## usage

see link:src/test/scala/org/neo4j/gatling/bolt/simulation/SimpleCreateSimulation.scala[SimpleCreateSimulation] for now
